----------------------------------------

* streamline the seascape products
* serve seascape products for other MBON nodes
* work with Joaquin on this
* move into Python and perhaps just extract directly from ERDDAP
* Joaquin can generate the most of the sat products and serve via ERDDAP. Then we just extract and push to grafana.
* other tasks via python, like
    * fetching river or buoy data or 
    * doing the L2 processing. 
    * We could maybe end up with a little notebook to 
        * process a set of L2 files. 
        * Creating weekly/monthly means, 
        * mapping data
