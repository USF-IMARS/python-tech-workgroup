This folder will probably need multiple files to add depth data to the BB3 data.

Currently, all I have is a script that will take bulk BB3 data from mutiple stations and separate them out with user input to have files with station start time and station ID.

I will need help creating a script that takes the results of this separation and CTD depth data and match them based on their timestamps.
