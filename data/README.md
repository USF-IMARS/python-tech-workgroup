This directory contains example data files that we will work with.

The files here should be small so **please do not add anything that is bigger than `10MB`**.

If you are trying to work with data larger than `10MB` please see [binder-examples/getting-data](https://github.com/binder-examples/getting-data) for details on how to load data into the binder container on startup or stream data on demand.
