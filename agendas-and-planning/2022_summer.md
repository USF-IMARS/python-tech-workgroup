topic ideas:
1. Not knowing very common libraries that data scientist use (i.e. PANDAS) for loading data, manipulating, plotting, etc. Maybe if you could have a .md file with a list of them divided by use case and example of why you would use them. 
2. Syntax comparisons to R or MATLAB. I tend to have a hard time thinking about how to do similar actions in Python
        Python: for i in range(0, len(my_vec)):​
          print(my_vec[i])
        R: for(i in 1:length(my_vec)){
          print(my_vec[i])​
        }
        how to call functions seems different in python with {library}.{function}() vs in R {function}() or {library}::{function} if you didn't load it 
3. The different type of data structures and how to build them, how to check them, how to know when are able to be used with functions
        dictionaries, arrays​, etc
        I understand R data structures much better and I know how to find out that type and how to convert to what I would need, like vectors, dataframe, tibbles, matrix, etc, but I'm not too keen on data structures in Python, especially when loading and manipulating it.​
4. Common words in Python that make reading library functions confusing:
        objects, mutable, tuple, dict,

5. Practical Googling ideology 
        how to google for things that we can't quite put into words
